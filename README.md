# Titanic-Project

This project examines the famous Titanic passengers.
 In the file in order to overcome some null variants, I've used the mean value in order to replace null in age, and the mode for replacing embarked place. 
 In Order to answer some of the questions I've used satistic methods such as: correlation test, t-test, chi test and permutation test.


## Technolegy:
All tests and visualisation were performed using R Studio.
The pakages been used are:dplyr, ggplot2, ggpubr, corrplot, effectsize, lsr and nhstplot

## The Quastions:
1.Is there a significant difference in the average age of passengers among the categories?
2. Is there a significant correlation between the number of family members of the passengers on the ship and the ticket price?
3. Is there a dependency between the boarding place from which the passengers boarded and their class on the ship?
4.Is there a significant difference between the average ticket price paid by women aged 18-50 versus men aged 18-50?
5.Does age affect a passenger's chance of survival?


Thank you for reading.
